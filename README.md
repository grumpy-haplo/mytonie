# Current Status 
This software is untestet and still in development. Main features are not working. Therefore there is no Release. I will update here if a first version exists.

# What is this software?
This software is used to make a copy of your Tonies on disk and to manage them in a library. The software is a java desktop application. You need access to the internal data of your Toniebox (access to the Micro-SD card).

You can save the audiofile associated with a Tonie on disk and write it back to the Toniebox. You dont have to write back the associated audiofile, you can save another audiofile. In the current version its not possible to write own mp3/ogg or similar or to backup the Tonie-audiofile to a readable and usable format. You can only change the associated audiofile.
I.e. you save Tonie T1 with audiofile A1 and Tonie T2 with audiofile A2 and you can write back T1 with audiofile A2 so the audiofile A2 is played when you put Tonie T1 on the Toniebox. This also works for Creative Tonies and for any SLIX-L RFID-Tag.
